/**
 * Collab write gate — which bound docs are past their first sync, and how to
 * wait for that.
 *
 * A doc bound through the provider starts unsynced, and site writes are
 * refused wholesale while ANY bound doc is in that state: writing into an
 * unseeded doc would duplicate server content on merge. The window is
 * sub-second, so interactive editing never notices it.
 *
 * Programmatic callers do. A tool chain that creates a page and immediately
 * fills it lands inside the window nearly every time, and a refused write
 * reaches neither the relay nor the database — so such callers wait on
 * {@link whenCollabWritable} before mutating rather than reporting a success
 * the server never saw.
 *
 * This module owns only the gate registry. `collabBinding` owns the docs.
